                <h1>Our Business History</h1>
                <p>Gabriel's journey began some years ago when he worked at a local roasted chicken restaurant. This experience, coupled
                with the unwavering support and encouragement from close friends and family, inspired him to take a leap of faith. In
                2019, he transformed his backyard into a takeout restaurant, driven by a powerful motivation: "To provide support for my
                family and ensure a quality education for my children."<br>
                
                This dedication to his family became the cornerstone of Gabriel's work ethic. Every Saturday and Sunday, he rises early
                to begin the meticulous preparation of food and chickens for his customers. His commitment to quality and family values
                quickly resonated with the community, and over the past five years, his takeout restaurant has flourished. <br>
                
                Gabriel's business success is a testament to his hard work and the heartfelt motivation behind it. His dream is to
                expand beyond his backyard and open a full-fledged restaurant, continuing to develop and grow his business. Gabrielâ€™s
                story is not just one of entrepreneurial spirit but also of a man dedicated to providing a better future for his family,
                fueled by passion, perseverance, and community support. <br>
